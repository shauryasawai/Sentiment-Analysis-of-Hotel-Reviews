***Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews***

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews of a particular product or service. It uses a lexicon-based approach to analyze the polarity of the reviews (positive, negative, or neutral) and provides insights into customer satisfaction.

***Project Overview***

This project aims to understand the sentiment of customers based on their reviews by classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The approach used is a lexicon-based method, leveraging the TextBlob library to calculate the polarity of each review. The results can help businesses gauge customer satisfaction, identify areas of improvement, and improve products or services.

***Objectives:-***

1- Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.

2- Preprocess review data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing.

3- Classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using a lexicon-based approach.

4- Visualize sentiment distribution with various plots such as bar charts, word clouds, and histograms.

***Dataset-***
The dataset should be a CSV file containing customer reviews.

***Data Preprocessing***

We perform several preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data for analysis:

Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase.

Removing punctuation: Remove special characters and punctuation marks.

Tokenization: Split text into individual words.

Stopword removal: Remove common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and").

Lemmatization: Convert words to their base forms (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").


***Sentiment Analysis***

We use TextBlob to compute the sentiment polarity of each review. The polarity score ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).

Positive Sentiment: Polarity > 0

Negative Sentiment: Polarity < 0

Neutral Sentiment: Polarity = 0
